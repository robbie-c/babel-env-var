# babel-env-var

Inline environment variables (or .env files) at build time

# Caveat

Like many babel-based approaches to .env files, this will not always pick up changes, and this can be particularly time-wasting or even dangerous.

The author @robbie-c does not recommend this type of approach any more, and instead would suggest alternatives. Some include:
* Autogenerated config files containing whatever whitelisted env vars you would like to include. These can be added to a watchman watchlist or similar.
* For a react-native app you can use build variants, and pull in those variables into JS code.
* Basically like infinity other approaches.

# Quick Start

Add something like this to your babel config:
```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    plugins: [
      [
        require("babel-env-var"),
        {
          dotEnvDir: path.resolve(__dirname),
          whitelist: ["MY_ENV_VAR"],
          defaults: {
            MY_ENV_VAR: "some important environment variable"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
};
```

Then in your code:
```javascript
import { MY_ENV_VAR } from "babel-env-var/imports";
console.log(MY_ENV_VAR);
```
